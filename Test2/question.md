Two sequence files named ‘swissprot.txt’ and ‘genbank.txt’ are given. Write a program to perform the followings:-
1. get the input file name from user
2. extract the following information from the sequence file entered by user in (1)

   • swissprot – the ID, AC and sequence

   • genbank – the LOCUS, ACCESSION and sequence
4. print the extracted information from (2) in FASTA format, with the following formats

    • The HEADER line consists of the ID and AC (for the swissprot file) or LOCUS and ACCESSION (for the genbank file)

   • The SEQUENCE line is in 100 characters length

Concepts such as file handling, regular expression and function must be shown in the solution.
